# Horiseon Refactoring

Refactor existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to adhere to current HTML5 standards and improve accessibility.


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```


## Acceptance Criteria


```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

# Description

For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

The main aim for this project is web accessibility. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 

Accessibility is good for business, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

I completed this challange by updating the code to HTML5 mark-up language and improving acessibility by adding attributes that can be read by a screen reader.
