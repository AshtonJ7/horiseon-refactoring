# Week 1 Refactoring Challenge

Refactor existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to adhere to current HTML5 standards and improve accessibility.

# Description

For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

The main aim for this project is web accessibility. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 

Accessibility is good for business, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.
